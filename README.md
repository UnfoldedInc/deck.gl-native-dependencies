The revision of built libraries can be found in the build script, [./build.sh](./build.sh)

**NOTE:** iOS libraries are currently being built manually, as `vcpkg` support is in early stages, and majority of the libraries do not have first-class support for iOS and its architectures. For more details on how specific libraries were built for iOS, see [iOS-BUILD.md](/docs/iOS-BUILD.md).

## Build instructions

This repository can be regenerated by `build.sh`. Remember to read the first lines because they delete your current artifact directories!

`build.sh` uses the following environment variables:

| Variable    	| Description                                                            	| Values                 	| Default Value 	|
|-------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------	|---------------	|
| DEPS_CONFIG 	| Build the given configuration of dependencies                          	| `debug`, `release`     	| `release`     	|
| DEPS_ARCH   	| Build to the given output directory. Must match the vcpkg triplet name 	| `x64-linux`, `x64-osx` 	| `x64-linux`   	|
